This courtyard housed a large pool full of man-eating sharks. For amusement, Azlaer would invite well-known citizens from nearby towns to his estate for an evening of dining and entertainment.

This entertainment consisted of Azlaer playing this harp, the effects of which removed any fear from his guests. Randomly, Azlaer would single out a guest and have him or her walk into the shark-filled pool. When in a particularly sadistic mood, Azlaer would first toss in blood, inciting the sharks into a frenzy that ended with the death of the helpless guest.

@6010 = ~In a valley far from most civilized lands, there once was a tiny kingdom called Chilldion. One winter evening a trio of evil witches overtook the valley and imprisoned the royal family by casting spells of holding upon them. The witches planned to eat the family one by one. Later that evening, the witches were exhausted after a hard day of slaying innocents and desecrating the palace, so they called for the court bard to play them a song. Methild the bard was loyal to his king and the king's family and so he used the special powers of his magic harp.

As he played, he focused his attention first on the king. As the song played on, the spell of holding upon the king dissipated, and the noble liege slowly crept away. One by one Methild freed his patrons, being careful to keep the witches' attention drawn his way. Finally, once all the family was free, the bard could play no longer and the witches saw his treachery. Poor Methild, unlike his lieges, did not escape and was served on the supper table in their place.
